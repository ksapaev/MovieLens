# Title
MovieLens Rating Prediction Project


## Introduction

Nowadays, data-driven companies use recommendation systems which can be facilitated to predict which rating a particular user will give to a particular product. Machine learning algorithms are applied in recommendations systems for providing insightful meaningful predictions. This project is also based on that approach,users were assigned to give specific recommendations for the movies. The project focuses on creating a movie recommendation system using the 10M version of the MovieLens dataset compiled by the GroupLens Research.   

This project aims to develop a machine learning algorithm that predicts user ratings (from 0.5 to 5 stars) using the data provided in the dataset  (edx dataset) to predict movie ratings in the given validation set.The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) will be used to evaluate the model performance. RMSE is a measure of how spread out the residuals are, it measures how concentrated the data is around the line of best fit. Models will be developed to compare RMSE in order to assess highest quality.The evaluation criteria for this algorithm is the RMSE expected to be lower than 0.8775.The best resulting model will be used to predict the movie ratings.
The formula of the RMSE is as follows:
$$ RMSE = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N}\displaystyle\sum_{u,i} (\hat{y}_{u,i}-y_{u,i})^{2}} $$


## Data preparation

```{r, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
#############################################################
# Create edx set and validation set
# Note: this process could take a couple of minutes as tidyverse and caret packages to be installed and files to be downloaded
# Loading libraries, if does not exist then installing first
if(!require(tidyverse)) install.packages("tidyverse", repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
if(!require(caret)) install.packages("caret", repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
dl <- tempfile()
download.file("http://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-10m.zip", dl)
ratings <- read.table(text = gsub("::", "\t", readLines(unzip(dl, "ml-10M100K/ratings.dat"))),
                      col.names = c("userId", "movieId", "rating", "timestamp"))
movies <- str_split_fixed(readLines(unzip(dl, "ml-10M100K/movies.dat")), "\\::", 3)
colnames(movies) <- c("movieId", "title", "genres")
movies <- as.data.frame(movies) %>% mutate(movieId = as.numeric(levels(movieId))[movieId],
                                           title = as.character(title),
                                           genres = as.character(genres))
movielens <- left_join(ratings, movies, by = "movieId")
```

The MovieLens dataset will be splitted into 2 subsets: (1) edx, a training subset to train the algorithm, and (2) validation, a test subset to test the movie ratings.  

```{r, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
# The Validation subset will be 10% of the MovieLens data.
set.seed(1)
test_index <- createDataPartition(y = movielens$rating, times = 1, p = 0.1, list = FALSE)
edx <- movielens[-test_index,]
temp <- movielens[test_index,]
#Make sure userId and movieId in validation set are also in edx subset:
validation <- temp %>%
  semi_join(edx, by = "movieId") %>%
  semi_join(edx, by = "userId")
# Add rows removed from validation set back into edx set
removed <- anti_join(temp, validation)
edx <- rbind(edx, removed)
rm(dl, ratings, movies, test_index, temp, movielens, removed)
```

\pagebreak


# Methods and Analysis


## Data Analysis

To have a clear vision of the dataset columns a summary was run on both subsets. The complete cases show no NA's in the subsets.

```{r summary, echo = FALSE}
summary(edx)
sum(complete.cases(edx))

summary(validation)
sum(complete.cases(validation))
```

Drama and comedy genres outnumber the rest of the genres.
```{r genres}
edx %>% group_by(genres) %>% summarize(count = n()) %>% arrange(desc(count))
```

Whole number and high number rates are preferred by the users. The distribution shows that rating 4 has the highest quantity followed by 3 and 5, the least common ratings are 1.5 and 0.5.
```{r rating}
edx %>% group_by(rating) %>% summarize(count = n()) %>% arrange(desc(count))
```
```{r rating_distribution, echo = FALSE}
 ggplot(edx, aes(rating)) + geom_bar(fill = "orange") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(seq(0.5,5,0.5))) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(seq(0, 2500000, 500000))) +
  theme_bw() + theme(panel.border = element_blank()) +
  ggtitle("Rating distribution of movies")
```

Edx subset has nearly 70,000 unique users and about 10,700 different movies.
```{r users_movies}
edx %>% summarize(Users = length(unique(userId)), Movies = length(unique(movieId)))
```


Not the all movies have the sufficient number of ratings. The histogram shows that some movies have only one rating (126 movies fall in that category) or less than 10 ratings. Regularisation and a penalty term applied to the models can be useful in this project. Regularization helps to choose preferred model complexity, so that model is better at predicting. Regularization is nothing but adding a penalty term to the objective function and control the model complexity using that penalty term.
``` {r per_movie_ratings, echo = FALSE, include = FALSE}
edx %>% group_by(movieId) %>% summarize(count = n()) %>% filter(count == 1) %>%
  left_join(edx, by = "movieId") %>% group_by(title) %>% summarize(rating = rating, count = count)
```

```{r per_movie_rating, echo = FALSE, fig.height=5, fig.width=8}
edx %>% count(movieId) %>% ggplot(aes(n)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 25) +
  scale_x_log10() +
  xlab("Number of ratings") +
  ylab("Number of movies") +
  ggtitle("Number of ratings per movie")
```

The majority of users have rated between 30 and 100 movies, thus a user penalty term should be included in the models. More recent movies get more user ratings. Movies earlier than 1930 get few ratings, whereas later movies get considerably more ratings.

```{r per_user_rating, echo = FALSE, fig.height=5, fig.width=8}
edx %>% count(userId) %>% ggplot(aes(n)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 25) +
  scale_x_log10() +
  xlab("Number of ratings") +
  ylab("Number of users") +
  ggtitle("Number of ratings per user")
```

Both movies and users affect the prediction results so, as modeling approaches I will use movie and user effect model and regularized model as well.

### Movie and user effect model

The RMSE is lower than 0.8775. The model has some uncertainty as large errors can increase the RMSE.
```{r, echo = TRUE}
# Mean rating of edx subset, movie and user averages
mu <- mean(edx$rating)
movie_avgs <- edx %>% group_by(movieId) %>% summarize(m_a = mean(rating - mu))
user_avgs <- edx %>% left_join(movie_avgs, by='movieId') %>% group_by(userId) %>%
  summarize(u_a = mean(rating - mu - m_a))

# Testing and saving the RMSE result 
predicted_ratings <- validation %>% left_join(movie_avgs, by='movieId') %>%
  left_join(user_avgs, by='userId') %>%
  mutate(predict = mu + m_a + u_a) %>% pull(predict)

movie_user_model_rmse <- RMSE(predicted_ratings, validation$rating)

# Checking the result
rmse_results <- tibble(method="Movie and user effect model", RMSE = movie_user_model_rmse)
rmse_results %>% knitr::kable()
```

When making predictions, exact number and prediction is necessary, not an interval. For this the concept of regularization can be introduced to penalize large estimates from small sample sizes. Regularization is is a method applied to decrease the overfitting effect.

### Regularized movie and user effect model

The best result was achieved at lambda = 5.25. The RMSE is lower than the result from the previous model.
```{r, echo = TRUE}
# lambda is a tuning parameter
lambdas <- seq(0, 10, 0.25)

# m_a and u_a for each lambda followed by prediction and testing the rating
rmses <- sapply(lambdas, function(l){
  mu <- mean(edx$rating)
  m_a <- edx %>% group_by(movieId) %>% summarize(m_a = sum(rating - mu)/(n()+l))
  u_a <- edx %>% left_join(m_a, by="movieId") %>% group_by(userId) %>%
    summarize(u_a = sum(rating - mu - m_a)/(n()+l))
  predicted_ratings <- validation %>% left_join(m_a, by = "movieId") %>%
    left_join(u_a, by = "userId") %>%
    mutate(predict = mu + m_a + u_a) %>% pull(predict)
  return(RMSE(predicted_ratings, validation$rating))
})

# Visualization of RMSEs vs lambdas to select the optimal lambda                                                             
qplot(lambdas, rmses)  

# The optimal lambda is the one with the minimal RMSE                                                          
lambda <- lambdas[which.min(rmses)]

# Checking the result with the result from the previous model  
rmse_results <- tibble(method="Regularized movie and user effect model", RMSE = min(rmses))
rmse_results %>% knitr::kable()                    
```


# Conclusion

The machine learning algorithm built to predict movie ratings with MovieLens dataset. The regularized model including the effect of user is characterized by the lower RMSE value and is the optimal model to use for the current project. The final model for the project is the following:

$$Y_{u, i} = \mu + m_{a} + u_{a} + \epsilon_{u, i}$$
The final model characterised by the RMSE value at 0.864817, lower than the evaluation criteria provided as a goal of the project.
